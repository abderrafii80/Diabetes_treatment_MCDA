## Introduction
Diabetes Ranking is an innovative project using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to evaluate and rank diabetes treatment options.
This project aims to help health professionals and patients make informed decisions taking into account several relevant criteria.

## Analysis Methods
The following MCDA methods are implemented for in-depth analysis:
+ ELECTRE I
+ PROMETHEE I
+ PROMETHEE II
+ PROMETHEE Gaia
+ TOPSIS

## Main Features
Multi-criteria decision analysis: Uses `ELECTRE I` , `PROMETHEE I` , `PROMETHEE II` , `PROMETHEE Gaia` and `TOPSIS` for a detailed evaluation.
Data standardization: Guarantees comparability between the different criteria.
Interactive visualization: Offers a visualization of the Gaia plan for an intuitive understanding of the decision criteria.


## Criteria considered
The project takes into account the following criteria to evaluate diabetes treatments:

* **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies, influencing the risk of gestational diabetes.
* **Glucose** : Blood glucose level, a key indicator for diagnosing diabetes.
* **BloodPressure** : Blood pressure, an important risk factor for diabetes complications.
* **SkinThickness** : Skinfold thickness, used to estimate the amount of body fat.
* **Insulin** : Level of insulin in the blood, crucial for understanding pancreatic function and insulin resistance.
* **BMI** : Body mass index, assessing the relationship between weight and height, influencing the risk of diabetes.
* **DiabetesPedigreeFunction** : Diabetes heredity function, assessing risk based on family history.
* **Age** : Age of the patient, because the risk of diabetes increases with age.
* **Outcome** : Diagnostic result, indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not.
